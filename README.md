Snowflake
=========

Snowflake is an emulator frontend designed to be highly modular and flexible. Everything from emulators to supported platforms are added through use of loadable plugin files. The GUI is written in Qt Markup Language and PyQt5.

It is the reference implementation of the [Icelake](https://github.com/ron975/icelake) specification. Both the Icelake spec and Snowflake are in early development, frequent changes are to be expected. For a concept of how the user interface will look when finished, please see http://git.io/snowflake
